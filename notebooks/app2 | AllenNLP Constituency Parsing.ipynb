      "    89,    273, We introduce a new language representa-_tion model called BERT, which stands for_Bidirectional Encoder Representations from_Transformers. Unlike recent language repre-_sentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-_ford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-_train deep bidirectional representations from_unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both_left and right context in all layers. As a re-_sult, the pre-trained BERT model can be ﬁne-_tuned with just one additional output layer_to create state-of-the-art models for a wide_range of tasks, such as question answering and_language inference, without substantial task-_speciﬁc architecture modiﬁcations._BERT is conceptually simple and empirically_powerful._It obtains new state-of-the-art re-_sults on eleven natural language processing_tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to_80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),_MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute_improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-_ing Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-_provement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1_(5.1 point absolute improvement)._Introduction_\n",
      "    71,     76, 1_Language model pre-training has been shown to_be effective for improving many natural language_processing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,_2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,_2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as_natural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;_Williams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan_and Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-_lationships between sentences by analyzing them_holistically, as well as token-level tasks such as_named entity recognition and question answering,_where models are required to produce ﬁne-grained_output at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and_De Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016)._\n",
      "   307,    416, There are two existing strategies for apply-_ing pre-trained language representations to down-_stream tasks: feature-based and ﬁne-tuning. The_feature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters_et al., 2018a), uses task-speciﬁc architectures that_include the pre-trained representations as addi-_tional features. The ﬁne-tuning approach, such as_the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI_GPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal_task-speciﬁc parameters, and is trained on the_downstream tasks by simply ﬁne-tuning all pre-_trained parameters. The two approaches share the_same objective function during pre-training, where_they use unidirectional language models to learn_general language representations._\n",
      "   307,    212, We argue that current techniques restrict the_power of the pre-trained representations, espe-_cially for the ﬁne-tuning approaches. The ma-_jor limitation is that standard language models are_unidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-_tectures that can be used during pre-training. For_example, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-_right architecture, where every token can only at-_tend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers_of the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-_strictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,_and could be very harmful when applying ﬁne-_tuning based approaches to token-level tasks such_as question answering, where it is crucial to incor-_porate context from both directions._\n",
      "   307,     76, In this paper, we improve the ﬁne-tuning based_approaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional_Encoder Representations_from Transformers._BERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-_rectionality constraint by using a “masked lan-_guage model” (MLM) pre-training objective, in-_spired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The_masked language model randomly masks some of_the tokens from the input, and the objective is to_predict the original vocabulary id of the masked_\n",
      "    72,    657, word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-_right language model pre-training, the MLM ob-_jective enables the representation to fuse the left_and the right context, which allows us to pre-_train a deep bidirectional Transformer._In addi-_tion to the masked language model, we also use_a “next sentence prediction” task that jointly pre-_trains text-pair representations. The contributions_of our paper are as follows:_\n",
      "    74,    528, • We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional_pre-training for language representations. Un-_like Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-_tional language models for pre-training, BERT_uses masked language models to enable pre-_trained deep bidirectional representations. This_is also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which_uses a shallow concatenation of independently_trained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs._\n",
      "    74,    425, • We show that pre-trained representations reduce_the need for many heavily-engineered task-_speciﬁc architectures. BERT is the ﬁrst ﬁne-_tuning based representation model that achieves_state-of-the-art performance on a large suite_of sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-_forming many task-speciﬁc architectures._\n",
      "    74,    363, • BERT advances the state of the art for eleven_NLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-_els are available at https://github.com/_google-research/bert._\n",
      "    72,    292, 2 Related Work_There is a long history of pre-training general lan-_guage representations, and we brieﬂy review the_most widely-used approaches in this section._\n",
      "    72,     76, 2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches_Learning widely applicable representations of_words has been an active area of research for_decades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;_Ando and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and_neural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,_2014) methods._Pre-trained word embeddings_are an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-_fering signiﬁcant improvements over embeddings_learned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-_train word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-_guage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih_and Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-_criminate correct from incorrect words in left and_right context (Mikolov et al., 2013)._\n",
      "   307,    630, These approaches have been generalized to_coarser granularities, such as sentence embed-_dings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,_2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,_2014). To train sentence representations, prior_work has used objectives to rank candidate next_sentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and_Lee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-_tence words given a representation of the previous_sentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-_encoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016)._\n",
      "   307,    330, ELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,_2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-_search along a different dimension. They extract_context-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a_right-to-left language model. The contextual rep-_resentation of each token is the concatenation of_the left-to-right and right-to-left representations._When integrating contextual word embeddings_with existing task-speciﬁc architectures, ELMo_advances the state of the art for several major NLP_benchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-_tion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment_analysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity_recognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,_2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning_contextual representations through a task to pre-_dict a single word from both left and right context_using LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is_feature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus_et al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used_to improve the robustness of text generation mod-_els._\n",

The ﬁnal hidden state_corresponding to this token is used as the ag-_gregate sequence representation for classiﬁcation_tasks. Sentence pairs are packed together into a_single sequence. We differentiate the sentences in_two ways. First, we separate them with a special_token ([SEP]). Second, we add a learned embed-_ding to every token indicating whether it belongs_to sentence A or sentence B.

Unfortunately,_standard conditional language models can only be_trained left-to-right or right-to-left, since bidirec-_tional conditioning would allow each word to in-_directly “see itself”, and the model could trivially_predict the target word in a multi-layered context._\n",

In this_case, the ﬁnal hidden vectors corresponding to the_mask tokens are fed into an output softmax over_the vocabulary, as in a standard LM. In all of our_experiments, we mask 15% of all WordPiece to-_kens in each sequence at random.

To mitigate this, we do_not always replace “masked” words with the ac-_tual [MASK] token. The training data generator_chooses 15% of the token positions at random for_prediction. If the i-th token is chosen, we replace_the i-th token with (1) the [MASK] token 80% of_the time (2) a random token 10% of the time (3)_the unchanged i-th token 10% of the time.

The left-only constraint_was also applied at ﬁne-tuning, because removing_it introduced a pre-train/ﬁne-tune mismatch that_degraded downstream performance. Additionally,_this model was pre-trained without the NSP task._This is directly comparable to OpenAI GPT, but_using our larger training dataset, our input repre-_sentation, and our ﬁne-tuning scheme._\n",
      "    72,    172, We ﬁrst examine the impact brought by the NSP_task._In Table 5, we show that removing NSP_hurts performance signiﬁcantly on QNLI, MNLI,_and SQuAD 1.1. Next, we evaluate the impact_of training bidirectional representations by com-_paring “No NSP” to “LTR & No NSP”.

It is also perhaps surpris-_ing that we are able to achieve such signiﬁcant_improvements on top of models which are al-_ready quite large relative to the existing literature._For example, the largest Transformer explored in_Vaswani et al. (2017) is (L=6, H=1024, A=16)_with 100M parameters for the encoder, and the_largest Transformer we have found in the literature_is (L=64, H=512, A=2) with 235M parameters_(Al-Rfou et al., 2018).

However, we believe that_this is the ﬁrst work to demonstrate convinc-_ingly that scaling to extreme model sizes also_leads to large improvements on very small scale_tasks, provided that the model has been sufﬁ-_ciently pre-trained.

However, the feature-based approach,_where ﬁxed features are extracted from the pre-_trained model, has certain advantages. First, not_all tasks can be easily represented by a Trans-_former encoder architecture, and therefore require_a task-speciﬁc model architecture to be added._Second, there are major computational beneﬁts_to pre-compute an expensive representation of the_training data once and then run many experiments_with cheaper models on top of this representation._In this section, we compare the two approaches_by applying BERT to the CoNLL-2003 Named_Entity Recognition (NER) task (Tjong Kim Sang_and De Meulder, 2003).

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n',\n",
